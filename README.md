This is a simple Todo app I made just to get used to the idea of using state in React. 

This is the first react app I have made yet and might add addtitional features.

Currently it is a simple App with just 2 components, one being the todo task and the other being the on to add the task. This is abstraced to a component for future expansions for adding things like extra details.

Currently the state is held in the App.js to be able to save it to localStorage, after having made it originally with the state held in the task component.
